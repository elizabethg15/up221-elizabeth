## Profile
Hi everyone, I'm Elizabeth. I'm a second year MURP with a primary concentration in TPP and a secondary concentration in DD. Right now I also work half time on LA Mayor Karen Bass's transportation policy team. I'm from the Bay Area and did my undergrad in Walla Walla, WA (a real place!) 

My main passion area is sustainable transportation, primarily biking and walking, but also transit and whatever else makes living car-free or car-light possible. I'm also interested in climate change more generally, access to open space (city parks, state parks, national parks, wilderness), and the way different people experience being in public space along the lenses of race, gender, and sexuality. 

In my discretionary time, I like cooking, baking, running, biking, sewing, singing, podcasts, and tromping around outside.

## Course Description
UP 221 is a crash course in open source GIS spatial analysis and coding with Python that is relevant for urban planners.

## Project Ideas
My first choice of a project would be something related to bike infrastructure, but I'm also open to anything tangentially related to sustainable transportation, such as:
* Access to public space
* Urban forestry
* Timeline of project completion
* Integrating green stormwater infrastructure with transportation infrastructure
* Ways different societal groups experience transportation differently, such as proximity of childcare centers to bus stops

## Class Objectives
My personal reason for taking this class is to spruce up my GIS skills and to learn to integrate Python into the mix. I took two GIS ESRI-based classes in undergrad (2015-2017), which by now is a litte fuzzy and a couple software updates obsolete. I also was exposed to Python for the first time last spring in a Travel Behavior Analysis course, but I don't expect that to put me at much of an advantage after the second week :sweat_smile:
