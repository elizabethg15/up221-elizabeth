## Thinking Cap

The article I would like to feature is from the Los Angeles Times on November 4, 2021, entitled [L.A. sheriffâ€™s deputies use minor stops to search bicyclists, with Latinos hit hardest](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-county-sheriff-bike-stops-analysis/). As someone looking to go into the sub-field of active transportation planning, this article opened my eyes to the ways that different people in varying geographies are treated differently riding a bike. LA Times reporters found that the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department (LASD) proceeded to search 85% of the folks they stopped on bikes, 7/10 of all folks stopped on bikes were Latino, and more stops occurred in poorer and high-POC areas of the county. LASD service terroritory includes unincoporated LA County, as well as some of the 88 cities in the county that contract out to LASD to provide public safety services, such as West Hollywood. LASD claimed to justify the searches because people on bikes may not have driver's licenses and are running from the law, though the arrest rate following these stops and searches was far below the average for pedestrian or motorist stops. LASD further claimed to not stop folks on bicycles for "exercise or amsuement," in effect dismissing the possiblity of utilitarian bicycling, which people do by choice and by need (and my personal goal is to make bicycling a more frequent mode choice for day-to-day activities). Many folks on bikes in the areas prone to these Sheriff stops are "bike dependent" and do not have a car or other transportation alternative. 

Consider the maps below: (Blue dot means individual was stopped, Yellow dot means individual was searched)

There was an accompanying [article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-04/how-we-reported-la-sheriffs-bike-stops) explaining how the reporting was done for this investigation. The journalists compiled incident data from an LASD public records act request from 2017-July 2021, UC Berkeley's TIMS database (Transportation Injury Mapping System), U.S. Census data, and crash data from the California Highway Patrol. This data was supplemented by contextual data such as maps of bike lanes from SCAG, LA County Department of Public Works, and the U.S. Census. Data from the City of Oakland Police Department was used as a benchmark to the LASD data. These data allowed for the creation of a basemap of existing bike lanes, which acts as a proxy to how much biking may be happening, and how much bicyclists would be riding on the sidewalk, which is more common when there aren't good bike lanes available, and one of the go-to excuses for LASD stopping a bicyclist (it is unlawful to ride on the sidewalk for any reason in unincorporated LA County). On top of the basemap are dots showing stops and searches, which I think does an effective job of comparing frequency across the two areas. I think it would have been more effective if the basemap also included a color-coding of racial demographics, since that was a key takeaway of the analysis. The article featured other graphics that showed racial disparities, but it would have been possible to include it all in one map.
